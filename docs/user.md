# User Manual for LocalLibraries

Our team at LocalLibraries will help residents of Prince George's County find libraries near them. We hope LocalLibraries will encourage Prince George's County residents to seek out libraries and expand their knowledge.


## Brief Tutorial

The application contains three tabs: Home (where the main application is), About (contains a brief tutorial and mission statement on the application), and Contact (where questions and concerns can be submitted. Please note this page is still a work in progress). 

### Using the Home Page

Navigate to the Home tab. There will be three functions viable to use in this application. 

#### Search via Library Zip Code, Name or Both

* Use the search bar inserting either a zipcode, library name or both options. Then select the <i>search</i> button to display results based on what the user inputted. 

#### Search via Filtering based on type of library

* Use the filtering option to select the branch type. The options are All, Other, County, University, and Federal. Then select the <i>search</i> button to display results based on what the user inputted.

#### No Search
* When there is no inputed information, pressing the search button will allow all the libraries located in Prince George's County will be displayed on the map.
