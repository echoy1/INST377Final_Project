## Briefing

#### Information Problem
Our group identified that not many people in Prince George's County visit the libraries around them, which is a waste considering they pay for it through their tax dollars, so we aim to change that. We wish to encourage the usage of libraries and raise library attendance. 

#### Stakeholders
The stakeholders for our tool are the people of Prince George's County, the County Executive: Angela Alsobrooks, and the managers/workers of PG County libraries.

#### Dataset
We are using the public Prince George's County dataset of libraries as a reference for our tool.

#### Strategies and Solutions
We decided to resolve our information problem by facilitating easy search up for libraries in a user's area. What our tool resulted in was a website that takes in the zip code and/or names of libraries and utilizes the public dataset from PG County to search and find the appropriate libraries closest to the query entered in whilst also displaying the map location for it. 


#### *Technical system decision rationale*

#### Addressing the Problem
We believe the tool we created can help address the lack of visitors to local libraries since the site is inviting, intuitive, accessible, and useful. It allows users in PG County to search for near local libraries.

#### Challenges 
- We had hoped for our website to be able to use the addresses of libraries but that proved to be complicated due to how the addresses were entered in the dataset. We supplemented this by using the zip code instead. 
- Working with Heroku and getting the server up and running was a definite challenge that we later overtook. 

#### Possible Future Work
* Improvements to be made include adding the address search functionality for better flexibility of the site.
* Familiarizing ourselves with the package Bulma to extract more out of it to entice even more users to the site.
* Facilitating some user testing to get a better idea of what to enhance on the site from a user experience standpoint.
* Add a working submitted issue form for the contact page of our webpage.
* Make the user able to press "Enter/Return" to search instead of clicking the button.
* Allow the user to search for libraries without having to refreshing the page.
